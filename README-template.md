## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to manipulate SVGs and change their colors, as well as integrate grid and flexbox. While it may not be the best solution, I had fun working on it. This exercise allowed me to reinforce my CSS knowledge, and I attempted to create a more organized HTML structure. It was an exercise that helped me better understand positioning and measurement units.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
main .footerContainer div button svg {
  fill: white;
}
```
